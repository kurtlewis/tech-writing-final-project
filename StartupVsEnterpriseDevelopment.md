# Introduction
There are a number of differences between working for a small or a large company. For someone looking to enter the workforce, or change employments, it can be difficult to know which companies to target. This document will outline some of the differences between small and large companies in the area of software development.
# Workflows
One of the largest differences between small and large companies is their workflows. Development cycles vary immensly from company to company, but trends begin to appear among small and large companies alike. 
Startups tend to be more 'agile', meaning that they can pivot tasks quickly, and have quick turnarounds from planning to implementation. In fact, many startups follow what they call an agile development process. This word can mean many things, but often takes the form of scrums, sprints, and user stories. These are devices used to encourage quick development, allowing for companies and teams to work around user needs, with a quick response team. Scrums, or daily standups, are meetings where all employees gather to share their progress, and goals. Sprints are often one to two weeks in length, with a well defined and attainable goal, usually based around a user story, or use case/need. 
Meanwhile, larger companies deal more with more logistics and red tape, ensuring that the planning process is entirely complete before moving on to implementation. Many companies subscribe to a waterfall method of software development, where the life cycle of software takes place in a number of stages. It begins with user requests and developer needs, and moves slowly through planning to implementation to testing. In a waterfall lifecycle, once a project has graduated to the next level, it cannot move upwards. This means that projects are well planned, but long term and unflexible. 
These differences aren't constants, but generalizations. Small teams at enterprise companies may have development workflows like those found at a large company, and a small company may prefer the rigid structure of waterfall development.
