# Introduction
There are a number of differences between working for a small or a large company. For someone looking to enter the workforce, or change employments, it can be difficult to know which companies to target. This document will outline some of the differences between small and large companies in the area of software development. While every company is different, I have generalized the differences between small and large companies, defining some key terms that might be prevalent during the job search. 
# Overview
 - Work flow
  - [Small](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#work-flows)
  - [Large](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#work-flows-1)
 
 One of the largest differences between small and large companies is their work flows. Development cycles vary immensely from company to company, but trends begin to appear among small and large companies.
 - Culture
  - [Small](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#culture)
  - [Large](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#culture-1)
 
 Company culture is one of the most important factors in workplace happiness. Large companies and small companies often differ greatly in culture. Culture is something that varies between companies just as much as work flows, but generalizations can be drawn between small and large companies.
 - Advancement
  - [Small](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#advancement)
  - [Large](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#advancement-1)

 Advancement works differently from company to company, but especially between large and small companies. For many, knowing what the path forward looks like is important when choosing a workplace.
 - Downsides
  - [Small](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#downsides)
  - [Large](https://github.com/kurtlewis/tech-writing-final-project/blob/master/StartupVsEnterpriseDevelopment.md#downsides-1)

 With any company there are downsides, some downsides can be generalized between large and small companies. Being aware of downsides is important, because no company, large or small, will be perfect in every regard.

# Small Companies
## Work flows
Startups tend to be more `agile`, meaning that they can pivot tasks quickly, and have quick turnarounds from planning to implementation. In fact, many startups follow what is known as an [`agile` development process.](http://agilemethodology.org/) This word can mean many things, but often takes the form of `scrums`, `sprints`, and `user stories`. These are devices used to encourage quick development, allowing for companies and teams to work around user needs, with a quick response time. Scrums, or daily stand ups, are meetings where all employees on a team gather to share their progress and goals for the day. Sprints are often one to two weeks in length, with a well defined and attainable goal, usually based around a user story, which is a use case or need. This rapid fire development process can lead to feelings of intense pressure for those who do not work well with deadlines, or consistent validation for those who operate well under regular pressure.

Employees at a small company also likely do a number of different jobs. They must do devops, development, testing, and requirements, all as a part of their normal day because the company is not large enough to support specialization.

## Culture
Small companies, especially those who deal primarily with software, tend to be more attuned to the open source community. Their quick turnaround times mean that they can leverage new technologies quicker, and some companies even encourage open source contribution as part of work. Startups have become infamous for their lax cultures, where employees may nap, play games, or work in informal environments. Dress codes vary from casual to business casual for software engineers. Employees at small companies are often much more invested in their company's project, as its success has a much more direct impact on their lives. The culture at startups are built to encourage employees to spend time at work, and often a `work-as-a-family` mentality is encouraged.

## Advancement
The small size of teams at small companies mean there are less positions at a small company, which means that there are in turn less positions to move into. In addition, raises depend upon the success of the company - a company struggling to succeed does not have the capital to invest in their already employed team. On the other hand, a very successful startup can reward employees with stock, bonuses, and free time to pursue personal interests. Raises can be based on a number of things, from reviews to overall productivity. 
## Downsides
At a small company, one of the largest challenges is providing value to investors. This means that sometimes employees are required to put in long hours for weeks at a time. This is expected behavior and defacto rule at many small companies. Additionally, many small companies do not have the budget to pay high salaries, and employees may be paid less then they are worth. The startup world is volatile, as companies vie for the funding necessary to stay alive. A startup struggling to establish itself offers little to no job security. Thus, employees must be passionate about the technology and goals of the organization.

# Large Companies

## Work flows
Larger companies face a different set of problems than small companies. Large organizations must deal with more logistics around managing more employees. This affects the development process, and many companies subscribe to a `waterfall` method of software development, where the life cycle of software takes place in a number of stages. Once complete, a stage cannot be revisited, ensuring that the planning process is entirely complete before moving on to implementation.  It begins with user requests and developer needs, and moves slowly through planning and design to implementation to testing. This means that projects are well planned, but long term and rigorous. Large companies often impose deadlines on their employees, but usually in the terms of weeks or months. 

At a large company, there are a number of positions, allowing for employees to specialize. There are often entire teams devoted to quality assurance and testing, devops, and development.

## Culture
Large companies are often restrictive of employee work, and while open source contribution is not unheard of, it is unlikely to be permitted by company policy. Many large companies have formal cultures, and dress code is often business casual to business formal. 
Large companies are often more diverse, with many different groups of people built around any number of interests. At a large company it is easier to find a group of people with similar hobbies and interests. Many large companies have sports leagues, gaming groups, and cultural groups at and after work. Large companies often have the capital to sponsor events for these groups, as they directly impact happiness at work.
## Advancement
Large companies are often very structured. Employees have any one of many titles, often including [junior developers, senior developers,](http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14914/whats-the-difference-between-entry-level-jr-sr-developers) project management, middle management, and executives. As such, many large companies have very structured paths towards advancement, with laid out raises and evaluation systems. Employees at some large companies may choose between working towards management or technical expertise, each with their own path of promotions.
## Downsides
Many employees of large companies work on a singular area of a single project. This has become known as [`software development as a commodity`](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/08/07/you-are-not-a-commodity/) in the software industry. This system allows for individuals to gather expertise on an area of the product. But for some, this is unsatisfying, and provides little variation in work.
Workplaces at large enterprise companies can be rather boring, large office buildings filled with rows of cubicles.
